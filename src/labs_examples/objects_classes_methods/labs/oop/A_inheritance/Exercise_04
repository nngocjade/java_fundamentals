Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.
        //TODO ask Ryan: Question: Why does this print? (I cant come up with a good logical explanation that makes sense) is the below explanation even legit?

ANSWER: The "Child Called" would print

        By definition of upcasting, in java, we can store a subclass object inside a parent class reference.

        c (parent class reference) is now the new Child() object and it is being invoked by c.doSomething() calling the specific
        constructor in the child class. Therefore, would print "Child Called".


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
