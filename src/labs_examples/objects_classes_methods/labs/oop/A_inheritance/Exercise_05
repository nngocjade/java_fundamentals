Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

ANSWER:
            //Output:
                        "Parent called"
                        "Child called"

Because, in an inheritance relationship, the order of execution of constructors is parent class to child class.
Since, c (parent reference) stores both the parent object and the child object therefore the order of execution of
constructors is implicitly called.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
