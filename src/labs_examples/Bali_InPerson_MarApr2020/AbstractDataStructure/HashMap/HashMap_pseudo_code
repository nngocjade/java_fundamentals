pseudo code for HashMap

                        public void remove (K key)
                        1. call the hash() to get index for "key"
                        2. check to see if array at index is null
                          -> return if so
                        3. if array at index is not a linkedlist (aka ".next" is null)
                           and array at index.getKey is equal to key
                          -> set array at index to null
                          -> return (to exit the loop)
                        4. Else, create an iterator containing the node object of array[index]
                        5. While iterator.next is not null and iterator.next .key != key (to remove)
                          -> iterate (iterator = iterator.next)
                        6. After while loop completes we either at the end of the list
                          -> if the last is one to delete -
                             set next to null
                          -> if the last is not the same key, we didnt find it in the list
                             return;
                        7. if we found key in next
                            .next.next != null
                            -> node.next = node.next.next
